# Instruction

A simple quiz game. There are about ten categories, each with its own difficulty level. The user can choose any of them, and there is also an option to choose randomly. For the easiest level, the player earns 1 point, for the medium level - 2 points, and for the difficult level - 3 points.

You can also play completely blindfolded by clicking the "I'm lucky" button. In this case, the player will be prompted to answer 10 questions from random categories and difficulty levels.

To answer a question, you need to select one of the four provided answer options. Statistics are kept for the last complete game and for all quizzes played on the device.

There is also category statistics where you can see which category the player encounters most frequently and on which ones he gave the most correct answers.

Enjoy the game!
